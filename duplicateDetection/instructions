Duplicate Detection of Python Files

Attached in this link, you will find a zipped version of the source files of
Assignment 1 submitted by your classmates. Each of these assignments has been
crudely anonymized so you may or may not recognize yours (resist from trying to
figure it out). Your task is to create a Linux script to do a pairwise
comparison of all the Python files. The goal is to produce a ranked list of
pairwise assignment pairs such that the first pair of python files is the most
similar and the last pair of python files is the least similar.

To compute similarity, use the Linux diff command. As you know, this command
lets you compare two files for textual similarity. Review the capability of
this tool and define your own approach for comparing similar documents. You can
use word, space, line or other comparisons types. You can break ties
arbitrarily, be careful with Unicode characters across comparisons.

Just describe your approach and assumptions in your README file. Also include
directions to for reproduction. Also give the output ranking that you obtain
from your script.

Hint, you may have to use multiple scripts. Feel free to use Python in your
script to help with your solution.

Some information needed was glossed over in the review and remediation section.
Feel free to use the discussion board to bounce ideas off of classmates to
accomplish the task.
